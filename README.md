# Web Crawler

## Description

This is the fourth guided project on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).

The following is excerpted from the [course introduction](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-web-crawler-javascript).

> Use JS to build a web crawler that any SEO expert would be happy to have. You'll make HTTP requests and parse HTML to generate reports that can easily marshaled to standard output or a file. If you're interested in getting a job using Node.js, this project will teach you how Node can be used to build a command-line application.
